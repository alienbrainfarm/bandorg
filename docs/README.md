## Documentation Contents
- `PRD.md`: Full Product Requirements Document
- Additional guides and technical documentation (coming soon)

## Getting Started
1. Review the `PRD.md` for detailed requirements and user stories.
2. Follow the technical architecture recommendations for setup.
3. Use the admin dashboard to manage member access.

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Environment Variables (`server/.env`)
Create a file named `.env` in the `server/` directory with the following content. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```
# Google OAuth Client ID - Obtain this from Google Cloud Console
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE

# Google OAuth Client Secret - Obtain this from Google Cloud Console
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE

# Session Secret - A long, random string for session encryption
SESSION_SECRET=YOUR_STRONG_RANDOM_SESSION_SECRET_HERE

# Admin Email - The email address of the default admin user
ADMIN_EMAIL=john@alien-planet.net
```

### 2. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) OAuth Setup Hints
To obtain your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`:

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
3.  Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **OAuth client ID**.
4.  Choose **Web application** as the Application type.
5.  Configure the following:
    *   **Name:** `bandorg_webclient` (or a name of your choice)
    *   **Authorized JavaScript origins:**
        *   `http://localhost:3001` (for local development)
    *   **Authorized redirect URIs:**
        *   `http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback` (for local development)
6.  Click **CREATE** and copy your Client ID and Client Secret into your `server/.env` file.

### 3. Install Dependencies and Run

After setting up the `.env` file and GCP credentials, you can install dependencies and run the application:

```bash
npm install # in the root directory to install concurrently
npm install # in the client directory
npm install # in the server directory
npm start # in the root directory to start both client and server
```

Alternatively, to run with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t bandorg .
docker run -p 3001:3001 bandorg
```
