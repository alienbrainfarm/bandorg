# Session Log

This file tracks the work completed during each development session.

## Session 0: Planning and Setup

*   **Date:** 2025-07-02
*   **Objective:** Analyze the project, identify discrepancies, and establish a development plan.
*   **Completed Tasks:**
    *   Analyzed `PRD.md` and the existing codebase.
    *   Created `docs/discrepancies.md` to document differences between the documentation and implementation.
    *   Created `docs/deployment_plan.md` to outline the steps for GCP deployment.
    *   Created this `docs/session_log.md` to track our progress.

## Session 1: Feature Completeness

*   **Date:** 2025-07-02
*   **Objective:** Implement and test the core features of the application.
*   **Completed Tasks:**
    *   Verified that event creation, editing, and deletion functionalities are working correctly.
    *   Added backend tests for event management APIs.
    *   Implemented and tested user management features (add, delete, promote/demote users).
    *   Added backend tests for user management APIs.

---

## Session 2: Testing

*   **Date:** 2025-07-02
*   **Objective:** Write frontend tests for all new features.
*   **Completed Tasks:**
    *   Created `client/src/components/EventModal.test.js` and added tests for event editing and deletion.
    *   Created `client/src/components/ManageUsersModal.test.js` and added tests for user management (add, promote, delete).
    *   Ensured all frontend tests are passing.

---

## Session 3: Documentation and Cleanup

*   **Date:** 2025-07-02
*   **Objective:** Update documentation and clean up unused code/files.
*   **Completed Tasks:**
    *   Updated `README.md` to reflect the current local development setup.
    *   Removed redundant `console.error` statements from `server/src/index.js`.
    *   Removed debugging `console.log` statement from `server/src/index.js`.

## Session 4: Dockerization Debugging and Superadmin Login

*   **Date:** 2025-07-02
*   **Objective:** Resolve Docker container issues and superadmin login problem.
*   **Problem:** Initial `ENOENT` error for client build files, followed by superadmin login failure (redirecting to login page after Google authentication).
*   **Debugging Steps & Changes:**
    *   Modified `server/src/index.js` to adjust `clientBuildPath` to an absolute path (`/app/client/build`) for Docker compatibility.
    *   Modified `server/src/index.js` to make all email comparisons case-insensitive (`.toLowerCase()`).
    *   Modified `Dockerfile` to correctly pass `ADMIN_EMAIL` as an `ENV` variable and ensure `authorized_users.json` is initialized with the correct lowercase admin email.
    *   Added extensive `console.log` statements in `server/src/index.js` (GoogleStrategy callback, `deserializeUser`, `isAuthenticated`, `/api/current_user`) to trace user object and `authorized_users.json` content.
    *   Identified that `authorized_users.json` was being incorrectly populated with literal `YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL` due to shell expansion issues in `Dockerfile`.
    *   Corrected `Dockerfile` to use `ENV ADMIN_EMAIL` and `tr` for lowercase conversion to ensure correct `authorized_users.json` content.
    *   Identified that the `authorized_users.json` file on the host was overwriting the one created in the Dockerfile.
*   **Current Status:** The `authorized_users.json` content is now correctly showing the admin email. However, the superadmin login issue persists, with the application returning to the login page after Google authentication. The `req.user` object is `undefined` in `/api/current_user` after login. Further investigation into session management and Passport.js flow is needed.
